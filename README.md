# sneha_bitroot_frontend_test
This is frontend created by sneha varude for the bitroot companies test project
This project includes completion of task given by company which states as below Instructions: You will build a simple React application that will fetch data from an API and display it using the attached design; We need to see that you know your way around CSS and JS, so this must be built without using existing React component libraries or CSS frameworks. You can, however, use any scaffolding tool (like create-react-app), or other NPM packages that might be useful; The React part of the application must be built using Function Components and Hooks (not classes); You can write your stylesheet in either plain CSS, or SCSS - bonus points for using SCSS; You should make sure the interface is responsive and works fine on mobile screens; We know we don't provide measurable references, so we don't expect this to be pixel perfect, but making it as close to the reference images as possible constitutes a big bonus; In this repository you will find two attached images that will be used as a reference to create your application; You can get creative with transitions, loading state and interactions; 
Design: As a starting reference, the container width for this application will be 1200px wide. The font family used across the whole design is Lato and you can request it from Google Fonts; The first image represents the main view of the app. Here you will display the data fetched from the API endpoint. The last card represents the card hover state; When clicking the Learn More button or the title, the modal from the second image should pop up;

Completed all requirements.
